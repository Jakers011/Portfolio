                <h1>What is this?</h1>
                <p>This is a game in which you must keep away from the obstacles (white blocks) that are synchronized to your choice of music.</p>
                <h1>Rules</h1>
                <h3>PLAY IN FULLSCREEN MODE</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>There are two modes: normal play mode and visualizer mode. Visualizer mode is if you just want to experience the full song and the visuals without having the pressure of playing the game.</li>
                <li>Choose a song: either select an already preset one or upload any music file of your choice. Note that the higher the BPM of the song, the more difficult it will be... but also will net you a higher score.</li>
                <li>Difficulty: The difficulty slider starts at 20 (the recommended level) and can have the difficulty increased all the way to 100. While adding difficulty can get you a higher score, it is much easier to lose a life.</li>
                <li>Obstacles: Avoid the white. While you are allowed to go to the top and bottom, be warned, wherever there is white obstacles can spawn on a beat (represented by a change of color). The white blocks that spawn and move around will cause you to lose a life if you hit them.</li>
                <li>Lives: You have three lives. Good Luck</li>
                <li>Scoring: At every beat (assuming that you are have not been hit within the last 5 seconds) you will gain points depending on the number of obstacles spawned. If you are within the sweet spot (the colored ellipse in the middle) on a beat, you will get 3X the score.</li>
                <li>Controls: Move with either WASD or the arrow keys. Your choice.</li>
                </ul>
